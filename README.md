## Compresses normal vectors (or any 3D unit vector) using [Octahedron encoding](https://knarkowicz.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/octahedron-normal-vector-encoding/).

This lossy compression scheme is able to achieve a compression ratio as high as 6:1 with an average error rate of less than 1 degree,
depending on which representation is chosen.

### Example:

```rust
let normal = [-0.5082557, 0.54751796, 0.6647558];

let encoded = normal_pack::EncodedUnitVector3U8::encode(normal);
let decoded = encoded.decode();

assert_eq!(decoded, [-0.52032965, 0.5473598, 0.6554802]);
```

### Why compress my normals?

It is common for 3D renderers to be bottlenecked by memory bandwidth, such as when loading normals from VRAM for high-poly meshes to supply to your vertex shader.
A smaller memory footprint for your normals corresponds to memory bandwidth savings and higher FPS in such scenarios.

### How bad is 1 degree of error?

The `teapot` example generates a reference visual and contains the wgsl code required to decode the vector in a shader.
